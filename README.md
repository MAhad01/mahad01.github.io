## Projects
### Myntra Review Scraper
[GitHub](https://github.com/MAhad01/myntra_review_project)

This project is a web application that allows users to scrape product reviews from Myntra (a popular Indian e-commerce website) based on a specified query. Users can enter a product query and specify the number of products they want to search for. The app then scrapes reviews for these products, displays them in a table, and provides an option to save the data to MongoDB. The results are also available as a downloadable spreadsheet.


### Sensor Fault Detection ML Project
[GitHub](https://github.com/MAhad01/sensorproject01)

This project is a machine learning-based application for detecting faults in sensor data. It uses Flask as a web framework, **Docker** for containerization, GitHub Actions for CI/CD, and **MongoDB** for data storage. The application can be deployed locally, on **AWS** EC2, or through Amazon ECR/ECS using an automated pipeline.

###  Mechano-Durability Analysis of Waste Material-Enhanced Concrete: An ML Approach
- Studied the mechanical and durability characteristics of the concrete using different industrial waste materials such as fly ash, iron slag, GGBS (Ground Granulated Blast furnace Slag), and jarosite.
- Utilized various ML algorithms to predict the mechanical and durability properties, bridging the knowledge gap where their application has been limited in previous studies.
- Applied SHAP analysis to check the features  on the predicted values.
